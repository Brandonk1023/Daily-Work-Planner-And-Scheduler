# Daily-Work-Planner-And-Scheduler

## Description

This project was created to help with user time management through out the working business day.  Allowing for a easy to use central spot to input events that needed to be remembered and tracked throughout the day.  In creating this project, I was able to learn more on 3rd party API's such as jQuery and Day.Js. I was also able to learn more on DOM manipulation and further solidify those skills.
